# constructing_red-black-tree

Created this project because i was a little bored on one saturday morning and
decided to read a paper entitled "Constructing Red-Black Trees" by Ralf Hinze
and thought it was an interesting exercise.

If you find any errors in the translation, do raise a pull request.

Many thanks
